This repository contains front-end code for the [Vilnius Pub](https://vilnius.pub) website.

The backend can be found in the [untappd-history](https://github.com/2m/untappd-history) repository.

Website charts are rendered using [Recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts).
A small [ScalaJs facade](https://github.com/2m/vilnius-pub/blob/master/src/main/scala/lt/dvim/untappd/Recharts.scala) is being maintained on a need-a-chart basis.
